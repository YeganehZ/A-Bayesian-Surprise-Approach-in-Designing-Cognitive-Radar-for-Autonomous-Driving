# A Bayesian Surprise Approach in Designing Cognitive Radar for Autonomous Driving

This repository contains my MATLAB codes for those interested in implementing my results published in "A Bayesian Surprise Approach in Designing Cognitive Radar for Autonomous Driving". I have included a PDF of my journal paper, followed by two folders named highway and urban. The highway file includes all the codes to run the highway driving experience discussed in the paper. Meanwhile, the urban file includes all the codes to run the urban driving experience depicted in the paper. In both files, please run the main file to plot the system performance for the root mean square relative error (RMSRE), Average Euclidean relative error (ARE), Harmonic average relative error (HRE), and Geometric average relative error (GRE). Before running the codes please review the simulation setup detailed thoroughly in Section 4 of the paper.
